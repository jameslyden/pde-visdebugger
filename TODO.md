To-do for VisDebugger
=====================

* Refine/better isolate new modular display functions
* Add slow update loop to stabilize some outputs
* move buffer entirely into header
* Add zoom scale to footer
* Add support for ADMP (comms protocol) v2
* Add burst mode (read and store samples in real time, but plot in batches)
